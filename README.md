For the first cube on the left, I created a shader that gradients on the x axis from white to black. It gave it a really cool ghostly look. For the second cube, I created another Three.js material similar to the one created in the tutorial. The third cube is the one from the tutorial made with a Three.js material. The forth cube is the other one from the tutorial made with a fragment shader.
